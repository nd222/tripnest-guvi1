                    Midway between the ornate gateway and the masjid at the Taj Mahal complex, on the western periphery
                    of the complex, is the Jal Mahal. This is one of two pavilions built at either end of a water
                    channel bisecting the charbagh gardens of the tomb. Jal Mahal houses the Taj Mahal Museum, a very
                    small selection of exhibits. Some pertain to the Taj itself: layouts, including a beautiful 19th
                    century one on cloth, a few paintings, mostly from the 20th century, farmans regarding the purchase
                    and construction of the Taj, and some details about the semi-precious stones used in it others, like
                    weapons, coins, and jade or celadon ware, are more generally Mughal.
